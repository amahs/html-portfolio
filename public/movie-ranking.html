<h3>Mona the Vampire </h3><img src="/4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/assets/images/Mona the Vampire.jpg" alt="Mona the Vampire" width="250">
<p>I love her adventures and how weird and quriky she was. The art style was fun too. </p>
<h3>Angela Anaconda</h3><img src="/4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/assets/images/Angela Anaconda.jpg" alt="Angela Anaconda" width="250">
<p>This had quite amazing cut style animation. Angela and her adventures were also very funny.</p>
<h3>Monster by Mistake</h3><img src="/4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/assets/images/Monster by mistake.jpg" alt="Monster by Mistake" width="250">
<p>Monster by Mistake had such a fresh style and idea about the show that made it so addicting!</p>
