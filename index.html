    <p>Monster by Mistake is a Canadian CGI-animated series that aired on YTV from September 18, 1999 to March 23, 2003 after airing its pilot in 1996. The series was created by Mark Mayerson of Catapult Productions, and co-produced with CCI Entertainment (formerly Cambium) in Toronto, Canada. The two companies partnered in Studio 345, a computer animation and former Sears catalogue production facility for the production of the show, which was made using Houdini software. It was one of the earliest TV shows to be entirely computer-animated.
